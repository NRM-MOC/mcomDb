This package contains a dataset of the Swedish National Monitoring Programme for Contaminants in Marine Biota (MCoM) funded by the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency and run by the Swedish Museum of Natural History. 
A description of the MCoM and dataset is found in Ammar, Y., Faxneld, S., Sk√∂ld, M., & Soerensen, A. L. (2024). Long-term dataset for contaminants in fish, mussels, and bird eggs from the Baltic Sea. Scientific Data, 11(1). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-024-03216-0. Note that the data descriptor was peer-reviewed in 2024 based on the data available on the platform at the time.

Intercalibration files are found for metals (intercalibration_metals), Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (intercalibration_PFAS.csv), Brominated Flame Retardants (intercalibration_BFR) and non-dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (ndl-PCBs), hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs), hexachlorobenzene (HCB), and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) (intercalibration_CLC.csv). These intercalibrations were made during laboratory changes for contaminants analyses. 

The package includes a function for shifting the MCoM dataset from a long to a wide format. 

To install the package: devtools::install_github("https://github.com/NRM-MOC/mcomDb", force = TRUE).
